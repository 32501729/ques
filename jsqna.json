    "questionNumber": "1088",
    "question": "Explain the concept of 'closures' in JavaScript, and provide an example.",
    "answer": "A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its parent function even after the parent function has finished executing. Here's an example:\n\n```\nfunction outer() {\n  var x = 10;\n  function inner() {\n    console.log(x);\n  }\n  return inner;\n}\n\nvar closure = outer();\nclosure(); // Outputs 10\n```\nIn this example, 'inner' is a closure that can access the 'x' variable even though 'outer' has finished executing."
